***Pages***
- *Landing Page*: List of blogs and short description under them. 
- *Add post*: Will make a new blog.

***User Stories***
- ü§î Who are our users, what do they want, and why?
- Users are anybody that wants to join my journey looking for a job. Can also join discord to get daily(randomized) coding problems.

***Wire Frames***

***MVP***
- Layout and Structure
- Models/database
- discord bot send coding question daily
- adding post for blog
- css(landing page, about, blog post, add blog)
- heroku upload

***POST-MVP***
- add timer to solve coding question
- add stackover flow api for easy access through discord
- read wagtail CMS documentation for django 
- search stackoverflow through my webpage?
- 
***Challenges*** 
-Discord interval function
- First tried to use a while loop that used a time.sleep() method but the other commands weren't working, reading through the documentation I found a built in method using @task.loop().
```
@tasks.loop(hours=12)
async def send_message():
    channel = client.get_channel(<enter channel id here>)
    new_url = GrabUrl.getUrl()
    await channel.send(new_url)
```

-Pagination
-Decided to use the built in bootstrap pagination but had to add a little bit of functionality to get it to work.
-Used this package documentation as a reference on how to build the structure(didn't use package)
[link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-paginate)
```
  const lastArticle = currentArticle * articlesPerPage
  const firstArticle = lastArticle - articlesPerPage
  const currentArticles = articles.slice(firstArticle, lastArticle)
  const pag = (pageNum) => {
    setCurrentArticle(pageNum)
  }
 ```
